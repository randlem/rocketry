# Project 1825 - Rocketry In the Industrial Morning

## Goal

The goal of this project is to explore the frontiers of rockety that could have been achived with modern engineering & knowledge but using technology avaiable circa 1825AD[^1].

## Rules

These rules are established to both ensure that all due safety is observed but also to frame the challenge established by our goal.

### Design Rules
* Modern desgin and analysis tools are allowed, such as popular CAD software or the OpenRocket simulation software
* Rocket must weigh approx 1500g and fit a H- or I-class model rocket engine
* Launch rail hardware may be of modern design and materials (safety)
* Shock cords may be of modern design and materials (safety)
* Rocket motoros may be of modern design and materials, unless a period-appropriate engine design is completed separately (with appropriate certs) (safety)
* No limits on material costs, though the actual estimated cost of the model in 1825 dollars could be fun trivia to have

### Material Rules
 
All materials used for rocket construction must meet at least one of the following conditions: 

* The material was commercially or generally available in 1825
* The material _could have been_ commercially produced using technology available in 1825 had sufficient experimentation been performed.
  * Vulcanised rubber was "discovered" in 1839 when Goodyear got a bit sloppy one day.  However, it had been used and was (somewhat) available in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations.  Also since nothing in Goodyear's discovery required tools or materials that were discovered after 1825, we deem it acceptable that vulcanized natural rubber is an acceptable material for this project.
  * Aluminium (first isolated in 1824) is a potential construction material but signficant quantities aren't possible using chemical techniques avaialble in the 1820s, it does not fulfill this rule.
  * The case could be made that many modern steel alloys would fall under this category, but consider 1) when those elements were isolated (and commercially available) and 2) could you reasonable and consistently recreate the alloy using 1825s technology.  The answer is probably not, likely to both so their use would be disallowed under this rule.  However, some types of carbon steels could be used under this rule.
* Materials which were known to science during 1825, but could not be commercially produced using technology circa 1825 _may_ be used.  The quantities and formats of these materials if used _must_ be in line with the possibilities of 1825 technology.
  * Aluminium can be used under this rule, but before the introduction of Hall-HÃ©roult process only small, impure quantities were available and usage must align with that.
 
Materials do not _actually_ have to be produced by period-appropriate methods.  It's totally cool to use modern, commercial hide glues, for instance.  We presume the average quality of most materials produced now is equivalent to the highest-qualitity materials available in the 1820s.  For some materials (such as steels) it should be assumed that the modern quality is superior to even the best quality contemporary materials.  While we don't disallow their use, we do feel that it's not in the spirit of the project to take advantage of their superior qualities in the design or construction of the model would would discourage large-scale use of such materials.

### Construction Rules
* Modern construction techniques can be used, so long as the materials and tools required for that technique could have been achievable in 1825 (no precision machine tools, no CNC, vac bags, etc)
* Modern power tools may be used so long as the process they perform could be completed by an equivalent, period-appropriate hand tool (and time and muscle)
* Modern precision measuring tools (such as rulers and calipers) may be used without restriction
* Any tooling required to be constructed for the project (such as molds or forms) should be constructed to the same period-restricted material, design, and constrution requirements as the model (e.g. no 3d printing forms, etc)
  
[^1]: Why 1825AD?  Well aluminum was first isolated that year, for starters.  But it also opens up the available tools and technology enough to support a variety of pathways that could be explored, including on the rocket motor front.
